HEXEXT

Supports IDA 7.0 only currently. (32 and 64)

This glorious plugin uses a variety of trickz to manipulate the internal IR of the Hexrays decompiler with the aim
of improving code generation.

Compiling this requires a compiler with at least C++17 support

right now documentation is very sparse I will be writing some up eventually
